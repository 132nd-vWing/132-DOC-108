\subsection{Target}

\subsubsection*{Simple Definitions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Target: Directive to assign a group to a flight for sensors (no shot
    implied)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{General}

In the case where a 132\nd mission has no AIC or the AIC is not qualified or
able to do Tactical Control or any other reason where no Commit has been
announced, OR the Flight Lead requires to split or deal with multiple groups
and clarity is needed, the following call must be made on Aux

\subsubsection*{Example}

\textbf{FL RIO (Aux):} "Spectre 1, \textbf{TARGET} Group \textbf{2 ship
echelon}, BRAA One one zero for 40, \textbf{twenty thousand, two hundred}"

\boxed{
  There is no AIC, Spectre has reached a committal for pre briefed reasons and
  is making an Informative call on Aux that they are targeting the mentioned
  group.
}


\boxed{
  Note, without Bullseye, this becomes a vague call to anyone listening in and
  the Altitude and formation is the best discriminator, so \textbf{vocal
  emphasis} on target, formation and altitude are important.
}
