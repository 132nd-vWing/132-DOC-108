\subsection{Employment (NLT 35nm)}

\subsubsection*{Simple Definitions}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Fox-3: Proword for declaring an Active Radar Homing Missile launch

  \item Gate: Proword for applying full Reheat or Afterburner on the throttle

  \item Buster: Proword for setting full non afterburner throttle (MILitary
    power)

  \item Gimbals: The limit of the radar Azimuth left or right (or elevation)

  \item Crank: A manouver taking the nose of the plane left or right until the
    radar contact is on the Gimbals (but still on scope)

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{General}

The RIO will call for "Go Gate, 20 degrees nose UP!" at their discretion, in
order to gain an energy advantage.

Flight will shoot, and crank together, \textbf{whether or not they have fired}.

\subsubsection*{Employ}

The actual employment geometry will depend on the altitude and aspect of the
targeted group. For head on, co-alt engagements, the 40-35nm time slice will
contain a zoom climb, followed by a crank and descend. Since 5nm closure
equates to \textapprox20 seconds, the use of Gate should not be too soon as to
give away intentions and use too much fuel, or too late as to not make use of
the energy.

\subsubsection*{Crank}

The Side to Crank is often decided by safety but is a hard turn to the radar
gimbals in the direction of (in order of importance):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Away from danger, SAM zones, other Enemy fighters
  \item Towards Safe zones, unengaged friendly fighters
  \item Cold side of the bandit
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection*{Example}

\textbf{FL RIO (Pri):} "Spectre 1, Go Gate! 20 degrees, nose up!" \\
\textbf{FL RIO (ICS):} "Steady up! Centre the T!" \\
\textbf{FL RIO (Aux):} "Spectre 1-1, Fox three, 2-ship, One-two zero for
thirty-five!" \\
\textbf{FL RIO (Pri):} "Crank left! Go Idle! Ten degrees nose down!" \\
\textbf{WM RIO (Aux):} "Spectre 1-2, Fox3 three, same group"

\boxed{%
  The RIO Flight lead commands a zoom climb, waits for the shot parameters to
  be met. Tells the pilot to centre the T and steady up which is the cue he is
  looking to employ. Shoots, announces it on Broadcast Aux. Wingman announces
  his shot. RIO directs crank and descend on Pri.
