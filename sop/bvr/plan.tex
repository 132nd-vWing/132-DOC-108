\subsection{Plan}



\subsubsection*{General}

After evaluating the targets behaviour and expectations, the Lead RIO formulates
and engagement plan which is briefed to entire flight on the Pri/Forward radio.

This ensures all members are able to anticipate the upcoming flow, reduce
uncertainty and ensures we operate in a coordinated manner and maximise
effectiveness.

\subsubsection*{Example}

\textbf{FL RIO (Pri):} "Spectre 1, PLAN: launch 35, standard sort, one
  shot each, crank left, skate zero six zero"
\textbf{WM RIO (Pri):} "Two"

or

\textbf{FL RIO (Pri):} "Spectre 1, PLAN: launch 40, lead low, two high, one
  shot each, crank right, skate south"\\
\textbf{WM RIO (Pri):} "Two"
