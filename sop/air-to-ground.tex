\section{AIR TO GROUND}

\subsection{The Tomcat Mission}

The Tomcat has quite Basic Air to Ground functionality as a general use 'bolt
on', however it does have PGM delivery via GBU, SEAD/decoy ability and large
dumb bomb capacity allowing it to work in more environments that at first
glance.

\textbf{Here are the differentiators:}

\begin{itemize}

  \item Firstly, it can carry mixed loads and thus can self protect

  \item Secondly it can out range and out speed many other airframes

  \item It has FAC(A) possibilities and laser designation in permissive and
    even non permissive environments. It's great loiter time allows it to
    designate for Buddy's

  \item Its dumb bomb deliveries are Visual delivery only and DL is not able to
    be trusted. Bomb deliveries are low level, multiple dive toss (inaccurate)
    and medium-high level dive bombing.

  \item Tomcat can carry large bombs that smaller fighters cannot employ.

  \item The Tomcat excels at deep strike which is its primary A-G mission

\end{itemize}

\subsection{LANTIRN}

The LANTIRN will restrict Mission altitudes to 24,000 feet or less for the
entire flight.

LANTIRN has poor resolution at distance and is best used for infrastructure
targeting and long- range interdiction

Deliveries include medium altitude, level bombing.


\subsection{CAS}

CAS is possible yet not part of our main mission set.

The pilot is always in command of the CAS flow and needs to ensure he, the RIO
and the JTAC/FAC are on the same page. A CAS qualified RIO can assist the pilot
by talking to the JTAC/FAC up until the "Tipping in" call by the pilot, from
then on the pilot continues the radio communication with the JTAC/FAC.

FAC(A) is limited by LANTIRN resolution and maximum height. It also has the
benefit of dedicated crewing.

\subsection{Gun}

The on board 20mm canon is accurate against soft skinned vehicles but it's
angled up barrel requires steep dives and only high angle strafe (HAS) is
recommended.

\subsection{SOPs}

All SOPs are contained in the relevant A-G TTP's for any airframe as there is
little restriction and many crossovers.
