\section{DOCUMENT SCOPE}

This guide outlines the procedures and responsibilities for aircrew operating
the DCS F-14B Tomcat in the context of flights organized and operated by the
132\nd Virtual Wing. This document does not preclude the use of good judgement,
when appropriate. Deviations from, and additions to these procedures, should,
at the judgement of the Mission Commander, be used if they positively affect
the safe and effective prosecution of the mission and mission's success as long
as all affected parties have a good understanding of the deviations at the
time, and this does not duly impact the spirit of 132\nd operations.

The scope of this document is constrained to F-14B specific operations and how
to work within the 132\nd Virtual Wing framework. It will provide new pilots a
guide to their new home and a good resource going forward for their future
flights, as well as the common grounds for which we operate.

This document is a living document that will grow and be refined as better
methods and clearer operating process are developed. Changes to this SOP will
be announced and Pilots should keep abreast of any changes.
